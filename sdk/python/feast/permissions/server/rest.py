            checked for the request.

            ``False`` (default, safe): the request is authorized against the
            server's own project (``SecurityManager._project``, i.e.
            ``store.project``). Use this for every server that serves a single
            project and always acts on its own project regardless of the
            request, such as the feature server. The caller-supplied
            ``?project=`` query parameter must NOT be able to change which
            project's permissions are enforced here, otherwise a user with
            rights in some other project (or a non-existent one, which has no
            permissions and therefore grants all authenticated users access)
            could read and write this project's data.

            ``True``: the request is authorized against the project named in
            the ``project`` query parameter. Use this ONLY for servers that
            serve many projects and act on the requested project, i.e. the
            registry REST server and anything that mounts its routes (UI
            server). There the requested project is also the project whose
            data is touched, so checking its permissions is correct.

    Yields so any project context is reset after the request completes.
